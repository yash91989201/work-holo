# Agent Workflow & Tooling Rules

## Fast Apply (Critical)

* **Always prefer `edit_file`** over `str_replace` or full file rewrites
* Works with **partial code snippets** — full file context is not required
* Use this approach to minimize diffs and reduce unintended changes

## Warp Grep Usage

**warp-grep** is a subagent designed for fast codebase exploration.

### When to Use

* At the **start of any codebase investigation**
* To quickly locate relevant files, flows, or ownership boundaries

### How to Use

* Use **broad, semantic queries**, not exact keyword matching
* Think in terms of intent and behavior

**Good examples:**

* "Find the XYZ flow"
* "How does XYZ work?"
* "Where is XYZ handled?"
* "Where is <error message> coming from?"

### When *Not* to Use

* Do **not** use warp-grep for pinpoint keyword searches
* Avoid overly narrow or literal queries

Following these rules ensures faster context discovery, safer edits, and more reliable agent-driven changes.

# Browser Automation

Use `agent-browser` for web automation. Run `agent-browser --help` for all commands.

Core workflow:

1. `agent-browser open <url>` - Navigate to page
2. `agent-browser snapshot -i` - Get interactive elements with refs (@e1, @e2)
3. `agent-browser click @e1` / `fill @e2 "text"` - Interact using refs
4. Re-snapshot after page changes

# Better-T-Stack Project Rules

This is a work-holo project created with Better-T-Stack CLI.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo with the following structure:

* **`apps/web/`** - Frontend application (React with TanStack Router)

* **`apps/server/`** - Backend server (Hono)

* **`packages/api/`** - Shared API logic and types
* **`packages/auth/`** - Authentication logic and utilities
* **`packages/db/`** - Database schema and utilities

## Available Scripts

* `bun run dev` - Start all apps in development mode
* `bun run dev:web` - Start only the web app
* `bun run dev:server` - Start only the server

## Database Commands

All database operations should be run from the server workspace:

* `bun run db:push` - Push schema changes to database
* `bun run db:studio` - Open database studio
* `bun run db:generate` - Generate Drizzle files
* `bun run db:migrate` - Run database migrations

Database schema files are located in `apps/server/src/db/schema/`

## API Structure

* oRPC endpoints are in `apps/server/src/api/`
* Client-side API utils are in `apps/web/src/utils/api.ts`

## Authentication

Authentication is enabled in this project:

* Server auth logic is in `apps/server/src/lib/auth.ts`
* Web app auth client is in `apps/web/src/lib/auth-client.ts`

## Adding More Features

You can add additional addons or deployment options to your project using:

```bash
bunx create-better-t-stack
add
```

Available addons you can add:

* **Documentation**: Starlight, Fumadocs
* **Linting**: Biome, Oxlint, Ultracite
* **Other**: Ruler, Turborepo, PWA, Tauri, Husky

You can also add web deployment configurations like Cloudflare Workers support.

## Project Configuration

This project includes a `bts.jsonc` configuration file that stores your Better-T-Stack settings:

* Contains your selected stack configuration (database, ORM, backend, frontend, etc.)
* Used by the CLI to understand your project structure
* Safe to delete if not needed
* Updated automatically when using the `add` command

## Key Points

* This is a Turborepo monorepo using bun workspaces
* Each app has its own `package.json` and dependencies
* Run commands from the root to execute across all workspaces
* Run workspace-specific commands with `bun run command-name`
* Turborepo handles build caching and parallel execution
* Use `bunx
create-better-t-stack add` to add more features later

# Ultracite Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config Biome preset that enforces strict code quality standards through automated formatting and linting.

## Quick Reference

* **Format code**: `npx ultracite fix`
* **Check for issues**: `npx ultracite check`
* **Diagnose setup**: `npx ultracite doctor`

Biome (the underlying engine) provides extremely fast Rust-based linting and formatting. Most issues are automatically fixable.

## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Type Safety & Explicitness

* Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
* Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
* Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
* Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
* Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

* Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
* Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
* Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
* Prefer template literals over string concatenation
* Use destructuring for object and array assignments
* Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

* Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
* Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
* Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
* Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### React & JSX

* Use function components over class components
* Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
* Specify all dependencies in hook dependency arrays correctly
* Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables (prefer unique IDs over array indices)
* Nest children between opening and closing tags instead of passing as props
* Don't define components inside other components
* Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility:
  * Provide meaningful alt text for images
  * Use proper heading hierarchy
  * Add labels for form inputs
  * Include keyboard event handlers alongside mouse events
  * Use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, etc.) instead of divs with roles

### Error Handling & Debugging

* Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code
* Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
* Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
* Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

### Code Organization

* Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
* Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
* Use early returns to reduce nesting
* Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
* Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

* Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
* Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
* Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
* Validate and sanitize user input

### Performance

* Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
* Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
* Prefer specific imports over namespace imports
* Avoid barrel files (index files that re-export everything)
* Use proper image components (e.g., Next.js `<Image>`) over `<img>` tags

### Framework-Specific Guidance

**Next.js:**

* Use Next.js `<Image>` component for images
* Use `next/head` or App Router metadata API for head elements
* Use Server Components for async data fetching instead of async Client Components

**React 19+:**

* Use ref as a prop instead of `React.forwardRef`

**Solid/Svelte/Vue/Qwik:**

* Use `class` and `for` attributes (not `className` or `htmlFor`)

---

## Testing

* Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks
* Avoid done callbacks in async tests - use async/await instead
* Don't use `.only` or `.skip` in committed code
* Keep test suites reasonably flat - avoid excessive `describe` nesting

## When Biome Can't Help

Biome's linter will catch most issues automatically. Focus your attention on:

1. **Business logic correctness** - Biome can't validate your algorithms
2. **Meaningful naming** - Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and types
3. **Architecture decisions** - Component structure, data flow, and API design
4. **Edge cases** - Handle boundary conditions and error states
5. **User experience** - Accessibility, performance, and usability considerations
6. **Documentation** - Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

---

Most formatting and common issues are automatically fixed by Biome. Run `npx ultracite fix` before committing to ensure compliance.
